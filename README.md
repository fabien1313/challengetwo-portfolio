# challengetwo-portfolio


## Description

This is my challenge two portfolio project for my coding bootcamp. Here, I attempted to use flexbox to structure my webpage. You will see a navigation with hover animations that will guide you to the section among the page. Currently all of the links will take you to my GitHub profile until those projects are created. The photos in the body section are titled and have anchors tied to them. Those will also take you to my GitHub until have the projects to fill in those "placeholders." The contact section provides a variety of ways to reach me also including hover animations and will direct you to my Github until I am able to create professional contact methods. 

Overall, this project was meant to showcase my ability to work with HTML and CSS. I still need a lot of work and heavily struggled with the design. However, I am very excited to see where I am a few weeks/months from now and look back on this project.

## Usage

Once I have the proper anchors to apply to all the interaction parts of this webpage (photos, resume, and contact me elements) it will serve as an effective portfolio. You will be able to see the projects I have created and my ability to perform within those projects.
